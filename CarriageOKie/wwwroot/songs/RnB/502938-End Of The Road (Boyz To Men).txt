We belong together
And you know that I'm right
Why do you play with my heart?
Why do you play with my mind?

Said we'd be forever
Said it'd never die
How could you love me and leave me
And never say goodbye?

When I can't sleep at night
Without holding you tight
Girl, each time I try
I just break down and cry
Pain in my head
Oh, I'd rather be dead
Spinnin' around and around

Although we've come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you
Come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you

Girl, I know you really love me,
You just don't realize
You've never been there before
It's only your first time

Maybe I'll forgive you
Maybe you'll try
We should be happy together
Forever, you and I

Will you love me again like you loved me before
This time I want you to love me much more
This time instead just come to my bed
And, baby, just don't let me down

Although we've come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go (can't let go)
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you
Come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you

Maybe I'll forgive you
Maybe you'll try
We should be happy together
Forever, you and I

I'm so lonely (lonely)
So lonely (lonely)
So lonely (lonely)
Lonely

This time instead just come to my bed
And, baby, don't let me down

Although we've come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you
Although we've come to the end of the road
(Oh, my God)
Still I can't let go
(My God, help me out a little bit, baby)
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you

We've come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you
Come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you
