Another night of loneliness.
My love is gone
She made a fuss and she was wrong,
yet she is gone

I asked her friends if they'd seen her
They said she'd take the train
I ran to catch the train,
Oh my, the train is gone

Another night of loneliness.
My love is gone
She made a fuss and she was wrong,
yet she is gone

I ran to catch the train,
Oh my, the train is gone
